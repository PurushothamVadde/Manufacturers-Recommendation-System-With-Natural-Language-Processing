# Manufacturers Recommendation System With Natural Language Processing

## Introduction:
As part of this project we are applying the Natural Language Processing on manufacturing capabilities of each manufacturer and the Input text (capabilities that user looking for) and provide the closest results related to the Input text to the user.\
To get the data of manufacturers, we followed the web scaring technique by which we collected the data from many online resources such as manufacturing websites, social media etc. After the collection of data we cleaned the data and used the TFIDF vectorizer to convert the input and manufacturer capabilities text into numerical matrix format, and we used the cosine similarity score to get the similarity score between the Input Text and Manufacturer capabilities and we displayed the manufacturers by highest similarity score to the user so that the user will get the suggestions based on the highest similarity score (suggestions that are related closely to the input text).
The detailed steps are mentioned as below.
